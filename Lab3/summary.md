## Summary 1-12 
TCP is a way for two computers to comunicate over a network. The first thing that happens is a handshake. Then packet transmission is started. The window size depends on packadge loss, buffer size at the reciver and sender aswell as congestion avoidance. Transmission starts with slow start and after a threshold it increases linearly. It increases untill buffersizes are met or untill packadge loss accurs.
